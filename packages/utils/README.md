# @brix-ui/utils

Utility functions and types for Brix UI.

_Intended for internal use._

---

## Installation

```shell script
npm i @brix-ui/utils # react
```

```shell script
yarn add @brix-ui/utils # react
```

> Make sure to have `react` installed in your package as it is included in our peer dependencies.

## Usage

This package provides two parts: `functions` and `types`. The latter is intended to be used with TypeScript only,
the former contains different utilities that are used under the hood of most of our packages.

Using those consider their predisposition for internal usage in the Brix UI ecosystem.
